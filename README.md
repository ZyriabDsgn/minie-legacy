## Minie - Minie is not IE ##

This is some 2013 memorabilia, Minie was a project I started at 17 when I wanted to go for an academic route after studying programming for 3 years by myself.
It should have been a "hook project" to grab the attention of the MIT where I wanted to study a CSEE master.

A project to better my (poor) skills on architecture and programming among other things.
Also, and more importantly, it was the vision of a great educational project for starting programmers like my young self and a totally free (and libre) software for everybody.

**The project was originally on GPLv3 but I moved it to MIT license because I don't believe in controlling what you do with code I gave you, anymore**
The licensing put inside each source file can be ignored.
I don't know why anyone would use any of this code tho :D

Welcome to the Minie wiki!

Here you'll find all the informations you need to understand, learn about and improve Minie.  

##### The actual version of Minie is the *0.2 alpha*
=========
### The Minie concept || What is Minie?
Minie is a Free(dom), simple & lightweight Web browser aiming to be an educational tool.

Most people will think : "Another browser, again? Don't we have enough of these?".  
Of course; we *could* have but Minie aims to be *simpler*, *lighter* and (so) easily hackable than the other browsers.  
Note as well that Minie embraces the [KISS principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_principle)!  

I have started Minie during Autumn 2013 with the idea that it'll help me improving my programming skills.  
During my preliminary researches in the field of computer science, late 2013, I have read about [Minix](http://www.minix3.org), developed by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, then saw Minie as a plausible community supported educational tool; for IT students, but not only.  

###### Please note that the similarity between Minie and Minix3 names is fortuitous  
=========
### Team and contributors
+ Arthur Wallendorff (flaco@core-unit.net) : developer, web admin, guru
+ Steven Ballester (Senar) : alpha tester

### Screenshots

##### *Minie v0.1a or Minie Prototype* 


###### Some screenshots of Minie v0.2a should come relatively quickly! (note from 2022: not really...)
=========

Finally, let say that Minie's motto could be :

> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication  

â€“ *Leonardo DaVinci*
